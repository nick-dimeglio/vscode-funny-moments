# On-Demand Family Guy Funny Moments for When You Code

## To activate this extension use either the `need more stimulation under my code ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€` command or the `need more stimulation to the side ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€` from the command palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P` / `â‡§ âŒ˜ P`)

## I stole a lot of this from https://github.com/jirkavrba/vscode-subway-surfers, and in honor of that, I have ensured that this also allows you to open a tab to the bottom of your viewport to allow you to watch subway surfers AND family guy funny moments at the same time. Coding has never been more entertaining.
